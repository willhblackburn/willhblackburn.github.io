**Aug 8, 2025** — *Why Boring AI Products Win*

Everyone's chasing the next ChatGPT wrapper or AI-powered everything. Meanwhile, the real opportunity is in boring, practical applications that solve specific business problems. At DevClarity, we're building AI for the unglamorous task of improving developer productivity metrics. It's not sexy, but it's valuable. The best AI products aren't the ones that demo well—they're the ones that quietly save companies hours every week. Focus on being useful, not impressive.

**Aug 7, 2025** — *The Power of Local Tech Communities*

Silicon Valley gets all the attention, but local tech communities are where real connections happen. Birmingham AI started as five people meeting for coffee. Now it's hundreds of developers, founders, and researchers pushing each other forward. The magic isn't in the size—it's in the consistency. Show up every month, help others without expecting returns, and watch what compounds. Your next co-founder is probably within 50 miles of you right now.

**Aug 6, 2025** — *What Books Don't Tell You About Startups*

I've read every startup book worth reading. They're useful for frameworks and mental models, but they miss the visceral reality: the 3am debugging sessions, the customer who ghosts after promising to sign, the co-founder tensions over seemingly trivial decisions. Books teach you strategy; only building teaches you execution. Read for perspective, but don't mistake knowledge for experience. The real education costs you sleep, not money.

**Aug 5, 2025** — *The 80/20 of Product Development*

After building multiple products, the pattern is clear: 80% of value comes from 20% of features. But here's what they don't tell you—you can't identify that 20% without building the other 80% first. The waste isn't waste; it's exploration. Ship fast, learn what users actually do (not what they say), then ruthlessly cut. Your MVP isn't minimal enough. Whatever you're building right now, cut it in half.

**Aug 4, 2025** — *Founder Psychology is Everything*

Your startup's biggest risk isn't competition, technology, or market timing. It's your own psychology. Can you handle rejection daily? Can you stay motivated without external validation? Can you make decisions with incomplete information? The technical challenges are solvable. The emotional ones break most founders. Before raising money or hiring, invest in your mental resilience. Everything else is downstream from that.
