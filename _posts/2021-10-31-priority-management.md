**Priority Management is the act of managing, setting, and working towards your priorities.**

It is different than Time Management. Time Management is scheduling items in your day. Priority Management makes sure the items you schedule are **what** you should be working on to begin with. Separate these in your mind and workflows.

Here are my top takeaways.

### 1. There is a *great & material* advantage to be had by people who manage their priorities well.

The "default" position loses to the well-prioritized many times over. There is a compounding effect. An extra 10% a day is a large advantage over a quarter, a year, a...

This is a science and art worth pursuing.

### 2. In the **"Information Age"**, it will never be about *"just getting things done."*

No one gives out awards to the person who does the most, and more importantly but harder to accept, no one cares. While this seems sobering, the good news is that there is a lot of interest and value in getting the **right things done.**

<br>
### 3. Busy, Overwhelmed, & Prioritized Full Capacity are three different things.

**Busy** = you are constantly in motion with little reason to your actions. You do not attempt to think if what you are doing is what you should be doing.

**Overwhelmed** = you try hard to make sure you work on important things, but you can never *catch up*. You are acting reactively, usually solving today's problems today.

**Prioritized Full Capacity** = though you never run out of things to do, you start each day knowing the most important thing to tackle. You are working proactively to solve tomorrow's problems, and you make sure you have time to think.

Work towards getting in the third group.

### 4. The ability to properly prioritize first requires knowledge gathering that does not feel directly tied to output.

If you are efficient, you judge yourself on pure output. If you are efficient & a student of priority, you judge yourself based on what you believe is the right output through results. Neither one of these systems would give any "value" to the initial knowledge gathering that is required to properly know what results you should care about in the first place.

Sitting in on meetings, having daily conversations with team members, asking your boss again what they view as the end result are essential daily practices of the well-prioritized worker. **If you do not do this step, you can do everything else right and still miss the target.**

<br>
### 5. The great executors prioritize the "next" thing they need to do, remove the rest from their mental backlog, and achieve it.

Then, because they have prepared themselves with the right base of knowledge to operate on, they know what to work on next from their backlog. **First things first**, and one thing at a time.

<br>
### 6. Beware of the "productivity traps."

These are things that trick you in to working on the 80% that produce 20% of the results. Examples being:

- Always tackling the "short items" that nicely fall into the urgent & important category while letting the big item you should really be working on sit in your backlog & gain interest.
- Using unpaired metrics that only evaluate the quantity of a work item and not its quality. Number of code releases (while not counting the number of bugs/issues). New MRR (while not looking at churn). Etc.
- Ever assuming that you have all the knowledge you need to properly prioritize your tasks going forward. Knowledge accumulation is a never ending game.

### Quotes:
From "The Effective Executive",
> This is the "secret" of those people who "do so many things" and apparently so many difficult things. They do only one at a time. As a result, they need much less time in the end than the rest of us.

From "High Output Management",
> Finally, remember that by saying "yes" --to projects, a course of action, or whatever--you are implicitly saying "no" to something else.
