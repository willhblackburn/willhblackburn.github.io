title: "How to Avoid BS During the AI Technological Evolution"
---

Just a few years after the crypto-craze, we have entered what will likely be an even quicker, more aggressive **AI-craze**. Here are a few tips that helped me navigate the crypto-craze. They apply today and to any technological evolution.

1. **Use the tech.** There is no substitute for using the new technology. It will give you a perspective you know to be true. You will have a foundation to understand what you hear from others. Keep ChatGPT bookmarked or open in a tab. Use it often and learn what it is good at and what it struggles with.

2. **Educate on the "how," not just the "what."** It is easy to focus on what AI can do. The question you need to ask is how it does it. Understand pretraining and prediction. Talk to ChatGPT to better understand how it works.

3. **Think through incentives & game theory.** Social media posters are playing an exposure & reaction game. They need views & clicks. When technology is quickly evolving, very few people understand things enough to call them out if they are lying or incorrect. The posters don't need to use AI; they just need your clicks.

4. **Think through your own incentives as well.** It is easy to make bad decisions and avoid warning signs when you will benefit from something. You need to have a higher bar when you will personally gain from it.

5. **If non-technical, find a technical guide.** Have someone you trust who understands things at a technical level. Ask questions and run things by them.
