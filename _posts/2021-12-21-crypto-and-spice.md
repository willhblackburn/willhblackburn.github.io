⚠ Dune Spoilers Ahead ⚠

With web3 & crypto, you have to use the tech to understand it. For it to make sense. It's like an activation or an awakening…

\~~~

In Frank Herbert's *Dune*, **Paul Atreides** begins training with his mother, Lady Jessica, at a young age. Paul learns the way of the **Bene Gesserit**, a pseudo-religious group of which his mother is a part.

He learns how to hear *truthness* in someone’s voice. How to speak to a person with authority they must obey. But he is young, and he is still training.

\~~~

Outside looking in, crypto or the cleaned-up term, **web3**, looks a bit cultish or religious. When first interacting with web3, you do so on a surface level. You hear about Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts, and NFTs. A website, a video, or your friends defines them for you.

With this understanding, you begin to learn. You read more articles. You create your Coinbase account. You buy Ethereum, Bitcoin, or the coin that you think is next up.

Or maybe you don't like what you hear. Your training moves slower, but that's okay. You are skeptical of the promises you have been told. You see fluff; you see greed. Yet, you still learn more every time you hear about it.

\~~~

**Paul** was forced away from his home to a desert planet, Dune. On this planet, spice was a natural resource that was extracted and delivered throughout the known universe—a sort of drug.

Paul's family was quickly attacked on Dune, forcing him & his mother into the desert. The spice would lay on the sand and be kicked around by the wind. As Paul wandered the desert, he inhaled the spice.

The spice **awakened** Paul's mind as it entered his body. Suddenly, with all of his training & work as a foundation, he could see the future. It wasn't an obvious future. Instead, it was paths ahead of him. This one, and that one. Not sure which path would happen, but Paul now knew certain things about the future.

**He was awakened by the spice and could never shut it off.**

\~~~

There's this **"down the rabbit hole"** meme in crypto that I think misses the point. Better stated, it's just the beginning of your crypto journey. Going “down the rabbit hole” is your training. Your education. You are not there yet.

When you begin to use crypto, when you try this and try that, you will experience an **awakening**. It is a revelation that no reading, no friend, nothing else can bring you. You will not encounter it until you hold the power & the opportunity that web3 brings with your own hands.

Once you do use it and experience the awakening, you are just like Paul. You can never turn it off. You can even see the future, though blurry. You know this tech will build much of the future. But you might not be sure exactly which network, which protocol... There are good outcomes and bad outcomes.

\~~~

The natives of Dune, the Fremen, led by Paul, fought for the good outcomes. They had inhaled the spice as well, and it had given them *"blue-within-blue"* eyes. They could look at one another and know who they were.

\~~~

So, if you have already been awakened, fight for the good outcomes.

And for those of you who do not yet understand, push yourself to try this. To experience for yourself. To form your own opinions with this experience. Many of us will be happy to show you the way.
